statefulness:
	- rackunit does not keep any config info except:
		- encryption key in EEPROM
		- rackunit MAC (must be set w/serial port or programmer OR maybe kevin's session id idea where controller leases out a session id)
		- optional non-default radio netgroup number
	- controller does not keep any config info except:
		- encryption key in EEPROM
		- controller channel ID (above 16)
		- optional non-default radio netgroup number
	- rackunits are always RID 1 thru 20
	- controllers are always 21 or higher, defaults to 21
	- rack units have a UID which can be obtained via:
		- asking controller for one (dynamic)
		- 1-wire serial number (must be distilled down somehow)
		- dip switches
		- from EEPROM

- when rackunit powers up:
	0. makeAllSafe()
	1. self diag (at least battery voltage)
	2. configure radio on channel 31 and start listening to broadcasts
	3. if an init broadcast is received, AND my init button is down
		- parse broadcast, if it is valid, configure myself according to how broadcast told me to (rackunits number 1 thru 20)
		- reply back to controller with my specific UUID, transmitting on the channel number (same as RID) specified by controller message
		- controller will ACK that my particular UUID is really allocated that RID
		- rackunit is now steady state loop

- when controller powers up
	0. init / safe
	1. diags
	2. IF safety key is in, loop waiting for safety key to come out before proceeding
	3. enumerate channels - give each RID 50ms to reply with his UUID message, if controller likes it, re-ACK to the RID+UUID.  this step covers us in case the control unit is reset for any reason (battery change or glitch)
		- if responses received, make association
	4. go into main loop

controller main loop:
- check safety key status, if state change to safe, safe everything
	- exceptions
- read rack selector
- if no racks initialized or init button pressed, go into init mode according to selected rack number
- controller: periodic broadcasts of which UUID has which RID.
	- if rackunit receives a control broadcast where UUID+RID pair does not match what he knows himself to be, he will turn link light off and self reset
	- if a club owns more than one controller (i.e. a backup), NEVER power up more than one controller in the same netgroup at the same time.  behavior if this were done is undefined
- iterate through table of known rackunits and solicit status
- check safety key
while safety status = armed
	(once after change into armed state)
	if firebutton = firing,
		- infinite loop waiting for fire button to be released
	else while safetystatus = armed
		- readSelectSwitches
		- transmit "armed" message to the selected rack with selections
		- wait ~50ms for rack to reply
			(message validation always)
		- if response
			validate
			if fault...
				?exceptions?
		else (no response)
			failuretorespond++
			if failuretorespond > threshold
				error lights or sounds
				inifinite loop waiting for safety status = safe
		- check firebutton
			call fire()
		- updateDisplay/audio
		} end of while



fire(RID,selectionMatrix) {
	while (safetykey = armed && firebutton down)
		- transmit firemessage with selectswitches as they were when we called fire()
		- wait firingListenTimeout for firing status back from rackunit
		- if response
			validate
			if fault...
				?exceptions?
		else (no response)
			failuretorespondwhilefiring++
			if failuretorespondwhilefiring > threshold
				error lights or sounds
				inifinite loop waiting for safety status = safe

		- updateDisplay/audio (i.e. audio might make diff sound if continuity goes away
	}
	// either firebutton released or safetykey = safe
}







- init loop
	- if safety key in, break()
	- if init pressed again or 60 seconds passes, break()
	- if rack selector changes, break()
	- else... loop broadcast message "i'd like to configure RID x"
	- listen for 100ms
	- if we get valid UUID and RID response
		- if UUID in EEPROM table, no specialness
		- if UUID == 0x00, generate one, make sure not dup, add to table
		- if UUID not in table, add it to EEPROM table
		- now ACK
		- happy tone or leds
		- return()
