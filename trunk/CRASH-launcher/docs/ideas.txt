WRT channel select interface:
- select switches could be just buttons... push once to select, again
        to deselect
- then if you select another BEFORE fire, its drag race
- otherwise, channel selected, press FIRE, still selected
        for multiple attempts of that channel
- once FIRE has been pressed one or more times, pressing any channel 
	button will cause the previous selection to be deselected, and
	 new channel enabled
- if safety key is removed, all channels are deselected automatically.  
	we currently have the problem of occasional channel left on, then
	on next rack of rockets, operator does not notice and clear the
	select switches, and we get unintentional launch of pad 8 maybe

- could also use boots over 1/4" toggles, they are made for marine use
