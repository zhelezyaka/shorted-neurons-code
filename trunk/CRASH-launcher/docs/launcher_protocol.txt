    -Receiver control command (bandwidth+modulation)
    -Current measurement
    -Remote/Self restart


Inititialize
    -Control broadcasts

Start in safe mode
Must send status at least once
Enter Arm mode
Then fire

To pad:

Rack number - 1 Byte
Rack UUID - 1 Byte
Command - 1 Byte
    -Initialize
    -Status
    -Arm
    -Fire
    -Safe
Command params (2 bytes below depending on command in previous byte)
    -Initialize - 2 bytes ACK
    -Status - 2 Bytes @ 0
         -No params
    -Arm - 1 Byte selected + 1 Byte always 0x00
         -Channels selected
    -Fire - 1 Byte selected + 1 Byte trigger
         -Channels selected
         -Channels to trigger
    -Safe - 2 Bytes always 0xFF
         -No params
Padding - 3 bytes
Total:8 bytes



From rack:

Rack ID - 1 Byte
Rack UUID - 1 Byte
Command last seen - 1 Byte
Channel state
    -Continuity - 1 Byte
    -Selected - 1 Byte
    -Firing - 1 Byte
Stats
    -Voltage - 1 Byte
    -Current - 1 Byte
Total: 8 bytes


Conditions
    -When any channel is Armed, If no good commands received in 250ms, then auto-safe rack
    -If a rackUnit auto-safes himself, he must hear three SAFE SAFE SAFE
broadcasts before he may receive an ARM command. 
    -what do "idle" rackUnits do with themselves?
