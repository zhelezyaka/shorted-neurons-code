20120820 - received first prototype PCB run from advanced circuits 

1. shunt spacing is a bit too small for one shunt that i can find.
2. power diode holes a little small, esp D4, D6 way too small for 3A diode
3. C6 footprint not big enough for most 3300uF (which was prolly overkill )
4. C4 footprint too big
5. back side masking error, mask over pad on LEDs D11 and D13
6. maybe on all LEDs???
7. R3 has odd value... perhaps trim pot for divider here would be better
8. inductor footprints not quite right... 4x4mm instead of 5x4 maybe (used Murata shielded ones)
9. D6 footprint too tight near caps (mounted on back)
10. cannot find my LM2576-ADJs, borrowed from breadboard
11. !! switching power supply started and outputting steady 3.7V on first try!
12. D2 should be 1N4001 or similar <100mA required
13. C1 and C2 is too big... 22uF or 47uF plenty @16V

14. TVS diodes seem wrong... i certainly dont have correct parts here, how about 1N6373 or 1N5908?

15. silkscreen for U1 (lp2950-30) is apparently backward... pin 1 is INPUT!

16. 12 divider values are wrong.  used R1= 32750ohms (33k), R2=5090ohms (5.1k)
17. next time, put fuse right on the board for 12V polarity mistakes
18. R15 (safety pull down for 12V rail FET) could be higher value, like 5.1k

19. !!! serial header to AVR rx/tx pins are backward (fixed with two cut traces and bridge wire)
20. serial tx/rx LEDs do not work as expected... something wrong with my transistor setup (disconnected for now)
21. Power out connector P3 does not have positive terminal connected.  very weird... copper generation error in kicad it seems
22. RFm12B to breadboard adapter should use either shorted pads or 330ohm resistors for R1 and R2.... much stronger pullup required
